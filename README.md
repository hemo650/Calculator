# Calculator with a GUI
This project was built for my Software Development class at San Francisco State University, the purpose of this calculator-application is to compute arithmetic expressions with Java. There are five main class files that constitute the bulk of this program, Operator.java, Operand.java, Evaulator.java, EvaluatorDriver.java, and EvaluatorUI.java.
